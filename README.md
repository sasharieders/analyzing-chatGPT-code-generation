<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Prerequisites
* Necessary library installations to use program:
  ```sh
  install nltk, openai, csv, sqlite3
  
  ```
* You will need an openai key. Get this at: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
* If you want to replicate my results, you will need the DeepFix database: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/deepfix
* You will also need the SOSum datasets: https://github.com/BonanKou/SOSum-A-Dataset-of-Extractive-Summaries-of-Stack-Overflow-Posts-and-labeling-tools/tree/main/data
* If you don't have an openai key, you can use the folders that contain my datasets. The first is fixedCode, which is a folder that contains C programs that were initially broken and fixed by chatGPT. The second is cCode, which contains C programs that were generated by chatGPT given textprompts, which are available in the DeepFix database.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is meant to be used for analyzing C programs generated by chatGPT along with analyzing chatGPT's ability to summarize text. Note that if you are using the free version of the chatGPT Turbo API, you only have a limited number of tokens. This program runs using Python3. 

## How to Run Program
The program runs out of main, but you'll need to generate code first before testing it. It all needs to be written in C.
